# Python_Practice
This is a repository where I build small things using python in order to practise. 
The first one is a simple calculator that is built primarily using the 'if statement'
The Second is the popular 'Fizzbuzz' challenge. The simple program will print out 1-100 and if its divisible by both 3 and 5. If it is only divisible by 3 then the computer indicates 'Fizz' and if its only 5 then 'buzz'. In this challenge we begin with both 3 and 5, then 5 then 3 because the computer process code line by line going downwards.
